The NWU came into being on 1 January 2004 through the merger of two universities with very different histories, personalities and cultures: the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education and the University of the North-West. The staff and students of the Sebokeng Campus of Vista University were also incorporated, adding further to the richness of our heritage. Today, five years after the merger, the NWU is recognised as one of the best-managed and most innovative universities in South Africa. As conveyed in our pay-off line, Innovation through diversity, we continue to celebrate and encourage multiculturalism, multilingualism and multinationalism."

Since then, the eight-track, floppy disks, the Walkman, VHS, and Sega Genesis have all but disappeared – 15 James Bond movies (with four different James Bonds) and seven presidential administrations have come and gone. And Pluto was still a planet! With the dawning of the Digital Era and Al Gore’s “information super highway,” it has been an online classified destination site, setting classified standards since 1995 – way before this thing called “e-mail” rendered postage stamps almost useless (besides purely philatelic uses, of course). Or, as we like to say around here, long before it was cool. Check it out…just Google “Classifieds” and you’ll see!"

We celebrate women (which may be why we’ve been so popular with them), and we publish women. We talk about fathers and sons without resorting to predictable clichés. We publish compelling features about the death penalty, adolescence, teen suicide, and addiction. We interview interesting men (James Franco, Junot Diaz, Duncan Roy) who are trying to be good men. We explore what the hell it means to be a good man, and we tackle the bad-man hype that seems to be everywhere these days. And we laugh. A lot. Because guys are funny creatures who accidentally set their girlfriend’s hair on fire. Can a men’s magazine that doesn’t caricaturize men prosper? Do men want to read about what it means to be a good man? We’re banking on it. And then banking on it some more. And then giving a substantial portion of our proceeds to organizations that help at-risk boys."

It is our goal to cover every aspect of this unique and vibrant culture–from the streets that spawn our increasingly creative music and fashion to the power players that direct the boardrooms and make our products into viable commodities and profitable investments. The Source has had unparalled achievements in our 20-year history. While the magazine was undoubtedly the foundation, The Source has created 20 years of content and our accomplishments stretch far beyond the pages of the magazine. Since our inception as a newsletter back in ‘88, The Source has documented everything Hip-Hop like none other, including exclusive interviews in print, on television and online. We have consistently extended our reach beyond the traditional realms of media with special Source music initiatives such as the Hip-Hop Hits compilation, the well reknowned 5 Mic music rating system, Spit 16–our unique program designed to expose unsigned artists, as well as producing the first-ever annual awards program centered on Hip-Hop, The Source Awards. With our eyes and ears steadily to the street, our wealth of content speaks volumes to the double decade history of our coverage and legacy in the game. It is this mission that continues to provide our driving force to be popular culture’s most entertaining, complete and respected brand in Hip-Hop and youth culture. From Source Latino to Source France and Source Japan, the influence of the Source is unrivaled in the global presentation of Hip-Hop. The Source’s coverage is dynamic and remains committed to our growing and diverse audience. Under new ownership, The Source’s NEW ERA will see the brand hitting even larger audiences through a wide-ranging multi-media platform that utilizes traditional methods like TV, radio and of course, the Source’s loyal newsstand base, cohesively with new media outlets like the web and mobile technologies. Without compromise, The Source remains committed to documenting the total lifestyle surrounding Hip-Hop that branches into every niche of popular culture worldwide. There’s a good reason why The Source has dominated as the most recognizable “source” of Hip-Hop and youth culture for the last 20 years."

We dig deep into issues guys in their 20’s face like career success and personal wellness. We strive for content that is not featured anywhere else. As men we are no longer interested in articles like “The 10 Best Spring Break Hot Spots” but are not ready for “Breakdown: 10 Spots to Escape Your Mid-Life Crisis.” At Primer, we search for new ways of bettering ourselves, as well as returning to the ideas of manhood that may have skipped our generation. As a departure from the status quo of typical men’s journalism, we are shredding the portrait Maxim and GQ paint of us. We’re over week-long binge drinking and the post-pubescent hunt for random hookups. We want to stay in shape and dress well but don’t relate to the idea of wanting or needing a $2,500 suit. It would be nice if we all had successful older brothers who were happily married, the life of every party, and made VP by 35. They could offer incalculable career advice, financial and investing tips, and key points to keeping your knockout girlfriend. While we all can’t be that lucky, Primer may be the next best thing. With writers contributing from all walks of life, we can learn from their experiences as if they were our own and apply them moving forward. As a young man leaving college, one must be ready to take on the world. Armed with an education, a sense of self, and toting a diploma, the world quickly reminds you – there’s more to living as an adult than is covered in ‘Comparative Politics’ and ‘A History of the Renaissance.’ Young men rejoice, you no longer need to stumble into the gate of adulthood."
