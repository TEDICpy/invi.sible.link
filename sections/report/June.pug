section
    h2 IACAP conference and presentation
    p.text I had my first presentation about third party trackers analysis, the content collected and the experience done would be reused in future presentations, a blogpost explaining the context will be published as soon as I make new visualizations with Tableau. I'm doing data investigation with that tool because it is much more efficient than develop my own visualizations before have understood the complexity of the data. I've written a blogpost in order to test a simplify communication on algorithsm, profiling and political impact:

        |  as the simplest way to check how the collection is doing

section
    h2 urlscan.io
    p.text I get in touch and obtain a key of uslscan.io, it is a service which monitor websites inclusion from their own infrastructure. Can be useful as comparison. A driver to use the service has still to be implemented.

section
    h2 WebTAP and their researches
    p.text The Web Transparency and Accountability Project, of Princeton University, I subscribed to get access to all of their data. They are doing a detailed analysis on the 1 million alexa websites. It could be an useful comparison mechanism in the pages that fits. Also, the Pinceton University has released some papers. The most interesting readings I had are:

section
   h2 PhantomJS will be unmaintained
   p.text This is not a big deal, considering the probes diversification I have in mind, but considering the capability of collecting OpenGraph data, probably I have to replace the support of phantomJS with 
       b nightmarejs
       |, but in general, I'll look forward for integrate once for all Thug.
