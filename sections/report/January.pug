    h1(class="reportTitle" id="January-17") January 2017

    h2 An update on the vision
    p.text Inspired by this title 
        a(href="https://points.datasociety.net/hacking-the-attention-economy-9fa1daca7a37") Hacking the attention economy
        |, Has become clear that my production has not just to be a website full of results, because a website has these limits:
    ul
        li one, or maybe more than one, targets. Every target audience require (in theory) appropriate terminology, design, knowledge of their context.
        li every target need to be notified on the existence of invi.sible.link projects, and this is stupid: invi.sible.link is a technical tool, nobody that can't run the code would ever to look these pages
        li a translation process is expensive and something useless. does it make any sense if I translate in Italian, the investigation made with CodingRights in LatAa? No.

    p.text This is a
        b pipeline
        |, a series of tools that constantly process input to produce output. My output has to be:
        ul
            li targeted: specific audience that care of their own stuff, of their content, of their business. Because the subject of the campagin would be a list of websites near the audience
            li simple: you can know how tracking works if you want, if you don't, at least you would know that someone in your digital environment is treating their user bad. and this feeling has to be the goal of the communication. making website responsible for their third party inclusions.
            li like a bot: act on notification via social media, not mobile first, but:  
                b bot first
                |!

    p.text Therefore, in this post-prototypel phase, campaign pipeline has to be the priority. This might permit to experience since the beginning how reach out to different social circles, and will force the prject in keeping an operating workflow despite the tecnical challenges that are going to be faced later.

    h2 first usage of the pipeline for political challenges

    h3 Concept
    p.text Users in mass follow crisis, events, moment of struggle. Social media virality help to focalize the attention over these topic, therefore when a critical moment happen, it rapresent a spike of attention. If an event of interest might be correlated to the third party trackers phenomena, it is my goal explain why. 
    h3 Reasons
    ul
        li Use the interest vector to get my message seen by a typically different audience. This is my only way to escape from my own filter bubble, otherwise I'll talk only to privacy activists.
        li The social and political impact of web survellaince can be understood only in moment of crisis, apparently. Otherwise, instead of being seen as a massive privacy violation, it is saw just as an advertising nuisance. A nuisance, but not strong enough to justify any action.

    p.text In the night of the #MuslimBan and the following days, has been clear how a segment of the population can the targeted by institutional attacks. Here I'm not concerned on the political debate, I'm focused only on the question: 
        b Where in the 2017 exists a registry of Religious view, usable to discriminate against segment of the population?
        |  I think is in the corporate profiling, because is a opaque, technically intermediate and heavily lobbied market sector. I want to use this risk, now that is polically hot, as leverage to attract users, adopters, and critical judgment on this subject.

    h3 As part of the roadmap
    p.text Declined campaigning is one of the goal of my fellowship, As seen in December, now that the pipeline works has to be tested on field. This experiment
        a(href="https://american.muslims.tracking.exposed") american.muslims.tracking.exposed
        |  has got its political moment earlier than the first planned experiment (online clinic with CodingRights) but the technology used is pretty the same.
