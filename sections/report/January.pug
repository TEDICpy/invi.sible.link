    h2 An update on the vision
    p.text Inspired by this title 
        a(href="https://points.datasociety.net/hacking-the-attention-economy-9fa1daca7a37") Hacking the attention economy
        |, Has become clear that my production has not just to be a website full of results, because a website has these limits:
    ul
        li one, or maybe more than one, targets. Every target audience require (in theory) appropriate terminology, design, knowledge of their context.
        li every target need to be notified on the existence of invi.sible.link projects, and this is stupid: invi.sible.link is a technical tool, nobody that can't run the code would ever to look these pages
        li a translation process is expensive and something useless. does it make any sense if I translate in Italian, the investigation made with CodingRights in LatAa? No.

    p.text This is a
        b pipeline
        |, a series of tools that constantly process input to produce output. My output has to be:
        ul
            li targeted: specific audience that care of their own stuff, of their content, of their business. Because the subject of the campagin would be a list of websites near the audience
            li simple: you can know how tracking works if you want, if you don't, at least you would know that someone in your digital environment is treating their user bad. and this feeling has to be the goal of the communication. making website responsible for their third party inclusions.
            li like a bot: act on notification via social media, not mobile first, but:  
                b bot first
                |!

    p.text Therefore, in this post-prototypel phase, campaign pipeline has to be the priority. This might permit to experience since the beginning how reach out to different social circles, and will force the prject in keeping an operating workflow despite the tecnical challenges that are going to be faced later.
