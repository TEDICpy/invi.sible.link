Source unit has to  contain:

source: "personX" or "alexa"
when: when added
keywords: "media", "france", "egypt", "xyz"
url: (page or domain)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This has to be imported from a CSV in github, and then
moved/uploaded in mongo with a dedicated pipeline for sources.

would be extended of:
. geoip of server location?
. doublin traceroute?
. pagerank

anyway, this extension are related to the source itself, not to
the fetched content
